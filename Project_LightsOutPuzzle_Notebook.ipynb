Classically it is cumbersome to list all the possible solutions to be able to start to check them, but here it was only as simple as applying hadamards. Then of course the second advantage which is the most important one is that we made 17 iterations where classically we would have done on average 256 iterations.\n","\n","The result from the histogram show that the solution is to flip all the switches in the top row, thee rightmost switch in the middle row and all the switches in the bottom row except the middle one.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QEm_nQonusmV"},"source":["<h3><center>.........................................................
